TODO:
* Implement player damage when colliding with enemy hitbox. We want to take damage once per second if the player
  is colliding with an enemy hitbox. Flash and then the player is invincible for 1 second.
* Also add a dodge roll with I-frames
* Add more upgrades:
	1. Magic missile type attack that circles the user but gradually increases radius
	2. Shield upgrade that blocks one attack
	3. Flying sword that orbits the player
* Add more enemies:
	1. Harder slime type (more health, different color, hits harder)
	2. Archer skeletons (projectile enemy type)
	3. First major boss enemy (will need a lot of work, maybe boss slime, need boss hp bar)
* Figure out a better way to have a TODO list. (some sort of open source Jira type thing?)
